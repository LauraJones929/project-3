# Portfolio Project 3 - Data Centric Backend Development

## Online Cookbook - Live Site

[View Live Site](http://flask-cookbook-project-3.herokuapp.com/)

## Business Objectives

As someone who thoroughly enjoys cooking but often struggles to relocate favourite recipes, I have designed and created a website that allows users to store all of their favourite recipes in one space. 

The primary focus for this website is to provide a database for the user so that they can store and access their own chosen recipes with just a few clicks. Users will also be able to add and delete recipes as they please.

The application is designed to be responsive to all screen sizes and accessible to all users, so that navigation is easy for everyone, no matter what device is being used. My goal is to achieve this with a visually appealing, interactive UX, which encourages users to:
- store their favourite recipes in an organised manner
- create/update/delete recipes as they choose
- share the website with friends and family to encourage them to sign up
- follow the company's social media platforms to see other users' recipes and ideas

## Homepage Mockup

## User Experience (UX)
### User Stories
**First Time Visitor Goals**

- As a first time visitor, I want to understand what the site's purpose is so that I know whether or not if I want to explore further.

- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily register so I can access the rest of the site.

**Returning Visitor Goals**
- As a returning user, I want to upload my favourite recipes and store them so they are easily accessible for another time.

- As a returning user, I want to manage my recipes by creating, updating and deleting them when necessary.

**Frequent Visitor Goals**
- As a frequent user, I want to be able to follow the company's social media platforms so that I can follow them and share my own recipes with them.

- As a frequent user, I want to be able to store a large variety of recipes in separate categories, in an organised manner, that are easy to locate when I need them.

**Site Owner Goals**
- As a site owner, I need to enforce some basic access control when a user is editing or deleting data in order to prevent unauthorised editing or deletion of user uploaded data.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
Colour contrast checks were made throughout the process of building the project to save going back and re-doing colours that did not work together.

The main colour scheme is clean and crisp, using different shades of *blue-grey* and *white*, in order to keep the site neutral. The look and feel I wanted to go for was the same look you want to go for with a clean kitchen. People feel most inspired to cook a nice meal when they have a fresh, clean looking kitchen. I wanted that same inspiration throughout the site, and that encourages users to keep their recipes organised.

There are some photographic images throughout, to tie in well with the theme of the site. These images are used on the landing page, and the recipe and category cards.

![Recipe Cards](documentation/images/features/photo.jpg)

The text throughout the site is either white against the blue-grey background, or a dark grey/black against a white background, in order to keep the clean, crisp look throughout the site.

### Typography

Fonts are imported into the CSS file via [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/)

To keep up with the clean and neutral look of the site, I chose to use just one font that is easy and simple to read.
I have chosen to use the font family of 'Montserrat', with a fallback font of 'san-serif', in the event of the preferred font failing to import. This font will hopefully create a positive user experience when first entering the site as it exudes a professional yet simplistic mood.

![Monseratt font](documentation/images/features/font.jpg)

### Imagery

Photographic imagery is used in some parts of the site, all images are sourced from [Pixabay.](https://pixabay.com/photos/search/)

The landing page consists of a header, background image and a footer. The image has been slightly darkened and the opacity reduced so that it wasn't too vibrant against the subtle colours of the header and footer.

This image gives the user a good idea of what the site is about upon entering. The appealing image of fresh food should give the user motivation to explore the site further.

The Recipes page that contains all of the users' recipes consists of 4 diet specific categories. Each category has a card element containing an image related to that category, e.g. an image of a vegetable curry for the vegetable category.

The Manage Categories page consists of 4 images for each category, these images are the same for each category for ease which I may change at a later date.

![Various Imagery](/documentation/images/features/imagery.jpg)

## Wireframes
Wireframes for the original design concepts across all devices were created using [Balsamiq.](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)

**Home Page**

The landing page explains the purpose of the site to new and returning users through imagery and subheadings. Functionality is limited from this page as users are only able to register, log-in or visit the company's social media platforms.

![Home Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/landingpage.jpg)

**Register Page**

Register page enables the user to create unique log-in credentials based on an alphanumeric Username and alphanumeric Password. Back-end logic tests for duplicate entries and password confirmation.

![Register Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/register.jpg)

**Log-in Page**

For returning users there is a log-in page to enable access to the full functionality of the site.

![Log-in Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/login.jpg)

**Profile Page**

Upon successful registration or logging in, users are directed to their profile page, consisting of a welcome message that contains the session users' username.

![Profile Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/profile.jpg)

**Recipe Page**

The Recipe page is the main attraction/functionality of the site. By retrieving the data from the Mongo database, recipes are displayed by category for the user to access. Users are also able to search and filter recipes by entering a recipe name or diet category.

![Recipes Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/myrecipes.jpg)

**Add Recipe Page**

Users can add a recipe by filling out the following input fields:

- Recipe Name
- Veggie Safe (on/off switch)
- Diet Category
- Cooking Time
- Cooking Skill Level
- Serves (how many)
- Ingredients
- Method

![Add a Recipe Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/addrecipe.jpg)

**Edit Recipe Page**

Each recipe has a edit & delete button. By clicking the *edit* button, users are directed to the Edit Recipe page, where all fields hold the value of the already submitted recipe. Users can change the input text as necessary and update to the database.

![Edit a Recipe Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/editrecipe.jpg)

**Manage Categories Page**

This page is restricted to the admin only, where they can choose to create, update or delete diet categories.

![Manage Categories Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/managecategories.jpg)

**Add Category Page**

After clicking the *Add Category* button on the previous page, users can populate the input field with a new category.

![Add Categories Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/addcategory.jpg)

**Edit Diet Category Page**

After clicking the *Edit* button on a specific category card, users can populate the input field with the updated category.

![Edit Category Page Wireframe](/documentation/images/wireframe-imgs/editcategory.jpg)

## Database schema

I used Mongo DB Atlas, a non-relational database to store and retrieve all of the user input data, illustrated below:

![Database](/documentation/images/features/data.jpg)

- The *Users* collection stores user data, including a usernsame and password that they will input each time they are required to log in. The username is used to populate the *created by* field in the *Recipes* collection when a user uploads a new recipe.

- The *Recipes* collection is the largest in the database and stores all user input regarding each recipe, as well as data retrieved from other collections. I included all elements of a recipe that I thought were most relevant for each field.

- The *Categories* collection consists of user input regarding the diet type of that recipe. Which is then injected into the *Recipes* collection as the *diet_name*.

## Personal Development
Following a session with my Code Institute mentor, I have noted that for future projects I will pay extra attention to how I am writing up CSS code, so that I don't end up with repetitive, unnecessary lines of code. In the meantime I am going to research different methods and ways of creating effective code that does not use a large amount of lines within the CSS file.

After writing my Personal Development section I decided to go back into my CSS file and attempt to slim down on the amount of code being used. I was able to remove approx. 200 lines of code by testing with Chrome Dev Tools and removing any unnecessary or repetitive code.
